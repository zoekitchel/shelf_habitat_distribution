How does habitat availability vary by depth within an LME?

```{r setup}
library(data.table)
library(rgdal)
library(hydroTSM)
```

How does habitat availability vary by depth
y = depth
x = habitat availability

Hypsographic curves for each LME (n = 66).
Include: (from Elsen and Tingley 2015)

* mean depth of each LME
* bottleneck depth of the leading edge of the LME (i.e., the depth below which area will always decrease, calculated as the minimum depth where the percent change in area equals zero) for a hypothetical marine species shifting deeper with climate warming
* class
* skew
* dip

```{r hysographic curves for each LME}
