title: "Practice Data Analysis Larval Traits"

Here we will practice some analyses to use on the larval fish morphology data. 

We're using a R Markdown Document. Here we can type freely, within chunks (grey) to type normal text as notes we have to start the line with a hash (#)

```{r setup}
#load packages or apps
library(tidyverse) #if you don't have it installed, you'll have to do that first by install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Bring in data stored as csvs
```{r load csvs}
photos <- read.csv("/Users/zoekitchel/Documents/grad school/Rutgers/mentoring/Justin/DataSheetPhotos_Practice.csv") #You'll have to change this path to match your machine, also note that for Windows, you will need to use backslashes instead of forward slashes (\ versus /)
measurements <- read.csv("/Users/zoekitchel/Documents/grad school/Rutgers/mentoring/Justin/Measurements_practice.csv")

icthy_data <- read.csv("/Users/zoekitchel/Documents/grad school/Rutgers/mentoring/Justin/icthy_data_Practice.csv")


```

Now we've loaded in three CSVs to data frames. You'll see them in your Environment in the top right. 

Now, let's take a look at these! 
```{r looking at data frames}
View(photos) #let's view it like a spreadsheet above
summary(photos) #overall summary and statistics
str(photos) #structure, are the columns in the right format?

#check this out for all of the data frames
#numerical columns should be <int> or <dbl>
```
It appears that photos has some extra useless columns, let's delete those
```{r delete extra columns }
View(photos)
#keep columns 1:8
photos_reduced <- photos[,1:7] #this tells us to make a new data frame extracting all rows from columns 1:8 (column = after comma, row = before comma]) in photos data frame
```

We also don't want the data from icthy_data that's not for our focal species
```{r}
summary(icthy_data$Species)

icthy_data_reduced <- icthy_data %>% #first, access icthy_data
  filter(Species == "dentatus" | Species == "undulatus") #then, filter out only rows where Species is eitheer dentatus or undulatus

summary(icthy_data_reduced$Species) #success!
```


We now need to merge these data frames together, which columns are the same across data frames?

```{r check column names}
colnames(photos_reduced)
colnames(measurements)
colnames(icthy_data_reduced)

#it can also be helpful to look at the first few rows
head(photos_reduced)
head(measurements)
head(icthy_data_reduced)

#check that all date columns are correctly formatted
photos_reduced$Tow.Date <- mdy(photos_reduced$Tow.Date) #tells R to interpret this column as a date in month, day, year format

#note that $ calls a specific column. RStudio is awesome, because once you start typing a column name it will give you options in a drop down menu

head(photos_reduced) #note it now says <date> under Tow.Date

#this needs to be done for all columns
```

Match Spp to Genus Spp
-In photos_reduced, species is under spp, but in icthy data species is under genus and species, we have to match them
```{r matching spp genus}
#make new Species column in photos_reduced data frame
photos_reduced$Species <- as.factor(word(photos_reduced$Spp,2,2, sep = " ")) #pull out species
#want to know how this is working?
?word
#make new Genus column in photos_reduced data frame
photos_reduced$Genus <- as.factor(word(photos_reduced$Spp,1,1, sep = " "))
  
```

Now, I've noticed that we use Tow_ID in photo data frame, but Tow in icthy_data_reduced data frame, let's match

```{r tow tow_id}
icthy_data_reduced$Tow_ID <- icthy_data_reduced$Tow
```

Time to merge! 

```{r merge}
icthy_data_photos <- inner_join(photos_reduced, icthy_data_reduced, by = c("Tow_ID", "Species", "Genus")) #first merge

full_merge_icthyoplankton <- inner_join(icthy_data_photos, measurements, by = c("Code"))

View(full_merge_icthyoplankton)
nrow(full_merge_icthyoplankton)
```

#Now it's time for analyses
A good way to  start each analysis is to ask a specific question. 

1. How does sample # change by date and location for each species?
```{r sample versus date}
ggplot(data = full_merge_icthyoplankton) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Tow.Date, y = Number, color = Species)) +
  facet_wrap(~Location) +
  theme_classic()
```
2. Does standard length vary by date? Is this pattern different for different locations and species?
```{r traits versus dates}
ggplot(data = full_merge_icthyoplankton) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x= Tow.Date, y = SL, color = Species)) +
  facet_wrap(~Location) +
  theme_classic()

summary(full_merge_icthyoplankton)

full_merge_icthyoplankton
```
3. Now, we can ask a ton of different questions 

Variables to include:
- Species
- Location
- Morphological traits
- Number of fish
- Temperature
- Date
